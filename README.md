# SAL413Project
This was a collaborative project for SAL 413 Analyzing Baseball Data with R completed with classmates Justin Harrington, Kushal Shah, and Colin Krantz

SAL 413 Analyzing Baseball Data with R is a course offered at Syracuse University that uses Ben Baumer, Jim Albert, and Max Marchi's Analyzing Baseball Data with R as 
a textbook reference to design a course curriculum that teaches advanced R programming, Sabermetrics, and Baseball Analytics. I completed this course and project in 
Spring 2020. This was a collaborative group project and my partners were Justin Harrington, Kushal Shah, and Colin Krantz. This was an open ended project, where we 
were allowed to choose any research interests to pursue in R with techniques that we had learned in class. Our group sought to determine the situational usages of 
pitch types in baseball and specifically which pitches were best and worst at inducing strikeouts and double plays. A wide variety of R techniques are used and the end 
product was given in a youtube video where each of us summarize our respective contributions to the R Markdown File. 

The youtube video can be found here: https://youtu.be/DCOG4go4uIE
All Data was scraped using the baseballr package.
the RMarkdown file is listed and entitled RFinalProjectCode.Rmd
